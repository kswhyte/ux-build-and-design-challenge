3 examples of reference/inspiration: MyFitnessPal's caloric + exercise input. Apple Watch's excercise rings. Fitbit's step progress.

Our target user is someone who wants a good combination of the caloric input plus the rings from fitbit and apple watches. And also a consolidated calendar to keep track of the workouts. Basically a app that takes the best of all three worlds. I think it'd probably be targeted towards an experienced fitness person.
